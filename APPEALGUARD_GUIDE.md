## Example Workflow

### Academic Misconduct Example

**Your Input:**
```
Institution: Stanford University
Issue: Plagiarism on Philosophy 101 Essay
Explanation: I didn't understand citation rules. I'm a first-gen student 
and no one in my family went to college. I thought if I rewrote things 
in my own words it was okay. I'm really scared and don't want to be 
expelled. I got an A on every other assignment. I've been stressed 
because my dad lost his job.
```

**AI Output Structure:**
```
[DATE]

Academic Integrity Committee

Re: Appeal of Academic Misconduct Finding - Philosophy 101

Dear Committee Members:

[Context paragraph explaining first-generation status, citation confusion]

[Mitigation paragraph about stress factors]

[Remedial actions already taken]

[Future preventative measures]

I respectfully request that the Committee consider these mitigating 
factors and my otherwise exemplary academic record when determining 
an appropriate sanction.

Respectfully submitted,
